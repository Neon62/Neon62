- 👋 Hi, I’m @Neon62

- 👀 I’m interested in a new career in infosec and ethical hacking, especially from a red team perspective.

- 🌱 I’m 59 years young, and currently learning Python 3. Next up is GO, then Java/Javascript/SQL. 
- - Then my Securty+ and Network+ certifications (I hope), and learning to hack this stuff in my spare time.
- - 
- - I spent 17 years as a Security Systems Controller, running software driven facilities security for 35+ buildings, 
- - thousands of doors, and 40,000+ people scattered over 3 states for a large healthcare organization, until my job 
- - was eliminated in 2019. 

- - Technology I managed included retina scanners, iris scanners, fingerprint readers, pin readers and proximity 
- - hid card access to everything from janitors closets to Nuclear Regulatory Commission monitored locations.

- 💞️ I’m not really looking to collaborate on anything unless someone wants to take me under their wing lol 

- - I am mostly (but not completely) a Linux noob, but I am currently running KDE Parrot OS Security edition on my antique 
- - HP 2000 laptop, and Ubuntu 21.10 Budgie on my core i7 desktop.

- 📫 How to reach me ... Neon1962@protonmail.com
